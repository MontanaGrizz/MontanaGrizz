# ***ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MontanaGrizz***
## Cyber security and automating tasks are interesting to me.

### Currently persuing my B.A. in cyber security. 
## Iâ€™m looking to collaborate or just share any interesting scripts I create
## Personally I would love to ditch windows all together! Might happen when I finish college.
